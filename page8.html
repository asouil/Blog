			<p>The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant. Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today.</p>
			<p>You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. <strong> You hit me with a cricket bat.</strong> <em> Aw, you're all Mr.</em> Grumpy Face today.</p>
			<h2>I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself.</h2>
			<p>No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister. No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do!</p>

			<p>I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.</p>

			<p>I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. Did I mention we have comfy chairs? I hate yogurt.

			<p>You hit me with a cricket bat. You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. Did I mention we have comfy chairs? You've swallowed a planet!</p>
			<p>Did I mention we have comfy chairs? Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. Did I mention we have comfy chairs? No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens!</p>
			<p>You hit me with a cricket bat. You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool.</p>

			<p>Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?</p>
