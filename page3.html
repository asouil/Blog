				<p>I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.</p>
				<p>No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. <strong> Call me the Rotmeister.</strong> <em> No, I'm the Doctor.</em> Don't call me the Rotmeister.</p>
				<h2>You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas?</h2>
				<p>Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you? I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!</li>
					<li>All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?</li>
					<li>You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?</li>

				<h3>Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time!</h3>
				<p>Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister. The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.</p>

					<li>You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas?</li>
					<li>Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush.</li>

				<p>You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.</p>
