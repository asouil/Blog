				<h3>Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush.</h3>
				<p>I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. Saving the world with meals on wheels.</p>

				<p>Saving the world with meals on wheels. No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! Did I mention we have comfy chairs?</p>
				<p>All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.</p>
				<p>Did I mention we have comfy chairs? All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?</p>
				<p>Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.</p>

				<p>Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. Did I mention we have comfy chairs?</p>
				<p>Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! You hit me with a cricket bat. Did I mention we have comfy chairs?</p>
