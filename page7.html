			<p>You've swallowed a planet! It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.</p>
			<p>You hit me with a cricket bat. Saving the world with meals on wheels. Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. <strong> I don't know why.</strong> <em> I call me the Doctor too.</em> I still don't know why.</p>
			<h2>The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.</h2>
			<p>You've swallowed a planet! It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff.</p>

				<li>I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!</li>
				<li>I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.</li>
				<li>Did I mention we have comfy chairs?</li>

			<h3>*Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do!</h3>
			<p>All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time!</p>

				<li>You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas?</li>

			<p>Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you? I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!</p>
			<p>Saving the world with meals on wheels. It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?</p>

			<p>The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant. Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today.</p>
			<p>I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness.</p>

			<p>All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself.</p>
