				<p>All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? You've swallowed a planet!</p>
				<p>You've swallowed a planet! Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. It's a fez. <strong> I wear a fez now.</strong> <em> Fezes are cool.</em> You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?</p>
				
				<h2>I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in.</h2>
				<p>No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. Saving the world with meals on wheels. I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do!</p>

				<p>You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself. The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.</p>

				<p>Did I mention we have comfy chairs? I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself. Saving the world with meals on wheels. Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.</p>
				<p>Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! Saving the world with meals on wheels. You hit me with a cricket bat. You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.</p>
				<p>I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.</p>
				<p>Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. You've swallowed a planet! All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?</p>

				<p>It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do! Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.</p>
