		<h1>It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'!</h1>
		<article>
			<p>I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.</p>
			<p>No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. You hit me with a cricket bat. Saving the world with meals on wheels. <strong> The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.</strong> <em>…hey.</em> …the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.</p>
			<h2>You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?</h2>
			<p>Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?</p>
			<ol>
				<li>All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?</li>
				<li>It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool.</li>
				<li>Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time!</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in.</h3>
			<p>You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? You've swallowed a planet! Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.</p>

				<li>No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.</li>

			<p>I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! You hit me with a cricket bat. No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister. You hit me with a cricket bat.</p>
			<p>You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks!</p>
			<p>You hit me with a cricket bat. I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?</p>

			<p>*Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do! They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool.</p>
			<p>Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you? I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!</p>
