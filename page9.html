			<p>No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister. The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.</p>
			<p>Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister. Annihilate? No. No violence. <strong> I won't stand for it.</strong> <em> Not now, not ever, do you understand me?!</em> I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?</p>
			<h2>I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.</h2>
			<p>Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?</p>

			<p>I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'!</p>

			<p>Saving the world with meals on wheels. You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.</p>
