			<p>No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister. I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?</p>
			<p>Did I mention we have comfy chairs? Did I mention we have comfy chairs? You hit me with a cricket bat. You hit me with a cricket bat. You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? Annihilate? No. No violence. <strong> I won't stand for it.</strong> <em> Not now, not ever, do you understand me?!</em> I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?</p>
			<h2>Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today.</h2>
			<p>I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.</li>
				<li>Saving the world with meals on wheels.</li>
				<li>You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME!</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>You've swallowed a planet!</h3>

			<p>I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself.</p>

			<p>No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool.</p>
